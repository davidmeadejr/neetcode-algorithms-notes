# RAM

## What is a Data Structure?

- In the context of computers a data structure is a way to organise data inside of RAM.

## RAM

- RAM is where all variables and data gets stored inside a computer

### Example

### Array of numbers

|   1   |   3   |   5   |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|

### RAM (Empty State)

|       |       |       |       |       |       |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|

- In the above diagrams the array contains the numbers 1, 3 and 5 are the information trying to be stored in RAM.
- RAM is measured in bytes, the "g" for example in 8gb refers to "giga" where 1 gigabyte = 10^9 (1 billion bytes)
- The "b" for example in 8gb refers to "byte" which is essentially 8 bits.
- Think of a bit as a position that can store a digit but said digit can only be a binary number e.g. 0s and 1s which are the language of computers.
- Individual bits can form multiple bits which can form bytes which can form RAM. This enables RAM to store advanced data structure.

|  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  Bit  |  →  |  Byte  |  →  |  RAM  |  →  | Data Structures |
